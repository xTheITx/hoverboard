However, process death and configuration changes put interesting restrictions on what kinds of architectures we can use for navigation compared with other platforms. This often means we end up with: <br/>a) Navigation that lacks strong typing, or navigation that's difficult to use in multi-module projects<br/>b) Navigation logic that is difficult to test in isolation<br/>c) Difficulties sharing data between screens<br/>d) Uncertainty over which layer of the application is really in control of navigation<br/><br/>In this talk, I propose a different way of thinking about navigation on Android, and how navigation architecture should work in general. This approach is simple, scalable and testable. <br/><br/>We will:<br/>* Recap abstract concepts of navigation on Android<br/>* Understand where current navigation approaches struggle<br/>* Explore a different approach to navigation<br/>* Examine practical examples of this approach",
