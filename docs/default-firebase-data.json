      "description": "Navigation is fundamental to how we build our Android applications. However, process death and configuration changes put interesting restrictions on what kinds of architectures we can use for navigation compared with other platforms. This often means we end up with: <br/>a) Navigation that lacks strong typing, or navigation that's difficult to use in multi-module projects<br/>b) Navigation logic that is difficult to test in isolation<br/>c) Difficulties sharing data between screens<br/>d) Uncertainty over which layer of the application is really in control of navigation<br/><br/>In this talk, I propose a different way of thinking about navigation on Android, and how navigation architecture should work in general. This approach is simple, scalable and testable. <br/><br/>We will:<br/>* Recap abstract concepts of navigation on Android<br/>* Understand where current navigation approaches struggle<br/>* Explore a different approach to navigation<br/>* Examine practical examples of this approach",
